Problem Statement:

1. If Z is norm(mean=0, sd=1)
Find P(Z > 2.64)
Find P(|Z| > 1.39)

Answer-
1. Find P(Z > 2.64)
pnorm(2.64, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = FALSE)
# P(Z > 2.64) is 0.0041


2. Find P(|Z| > 1.39)
1 - (pnorm(1.39, mean = 0, sd=1) - pnorm(-1.39, mean = 0, sd=1))
#  P(|Z| > 1.39) is 0.1645

2. Suppose p = the propotion of students who are admitted to the graduate school of the University of California at Berkeley,
and suppose that a public relation officer boasts that UCB has historically had a 40% acceptance rate for its graduate school.
Consider the data stored in the table UCBAdmissions from 1973. Assuming these observations constituted a simple random sample,
are they consistent with the officera..s claim, or do they provide evidence that the acceptance rate was significantly less 
than 40%?
Use an I(hat)+-0.01 significance level.

Answer-
# Here the Null Hypothesis is p=0.4
# And alternate Hypothesis is p<0.4

# The level of significance is 0.01 or 1%

-qnorm(0.99)
# z alpha = -2.326348

A <- as.data.frame(UCBAdmissions)
head(A)

xtabs(Freq ~ Admit, data = A)

# Or we calculate the value of the test statistic.
phat <- 1755/(1755 + 2771)
(phat - 0.4)/sqrt(0.4 * 0.6/(1755 + 2771))
# t statistics is -1.680919
# Our test statistic is not less than -2.32,

prop.test(1755, 1755 + 2771, p = 0.4, alternative = "less",
          conf.level = 0.99, correct = FALSE)

# p- value i.e. 0.046 is greater than alpha i.e. 0.01

library(IPSUR)
library(HH)
temp <- prop.test(1755, 1755 + 2771, p = 0.4, alternative = "less",
                    + conf.level = 0.99, correct = FALSE)
plot(temp, "Hypoth")
 
# So it does not fall into the critical region. 
# Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the true proportion 
# Of students admitted to graduate school is less than 40% and 
# Say that the observed data are consistent with the officer's claim at
# The alpha = 0.01 significance level.
